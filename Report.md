# Unsupervised Learning
In Machine learning, there are basically four types of learning: supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning
and reinforcement learning.
Dataset in unsupervised learning is collection of unlabeled examples. The goal of an unsupervised learning alogrithm is to create a model that takes a feture vector as input and either transforms it into another vector or into a value that can be used to solve a practical problem. For example, in clustering, the model returns the id of the cluster for each feature vector in the dataset. In dimensinality reduction, the output of the model is a feature vector that has fewer features than the input; in outlier detection, the output is a real number that indicates how input is different from a typical" example in the dataset.

# Summary of References
## An unsupervised learning method for perceived stress level recognition based on office working behavior
* In this paper, the author wants to study the relationship between working behaviors and stress level of people. The author uses the  unsupervised learning on the data set and found the relation of each cluster to a stress level, which was measured by using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).
* For data collection, the author use and collect data from Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and multiple sensors. For example, for the working behavior attributes, the force sensor embedded in seat cushion recognizes how often the subject change their posture from sitting to standing. And for enviornment, different sensors like temperature sensor will be connected to Arduino and collect data.
* For unsupervised learning, we could identify the similar working behavior which related to high or low stress more efficiently by using unsupervised learning and cluster analysis, the clustering algorithms we used in this process are k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering algorithm.

## Unsupervised Deep Transfer Feature Learning for Medical Image Classification
* There is a paucity of annotated data available due to the complexity of manual annotation, so to overcome this problem, we use unsupervised learning alogrithm.
* ropose a new hierarchical unsupervised feature extractor by introducing a zero-bias CAE placed atop of a pre-trained CNN


# Analysis of results including pros and cons
Since there is no label for the unsupervised learning, it retains it self-retention to find the structure in its input. Unsupervised learning is a challenging goal in itself. The training data consists of a set of input vectors x without any corresponding target value;
## Pros
1. The potential of hidden patterns can be very powerful for the business or even detect extremely amazing facts, fraud detection etc.
2. K-Means: The algorithm is simple and easy to implement.
3. It can detect what human eyes can not understand
4. Output can determine the un explored territories and new ventures for businesses. Exploratory analytics can be applied to understand the financial, business and operational drivers behind what happened.
## Cons
1. Unsupervised learning is harder as compared to supervised learning.
2. SUpervised learning is more efficient and accurate than unsupervised learning.
3. Usefulness of the results; are of any value or not is difficult to confirm since no answer labels are available.
